```


## load the file
```{r}
weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

## clean the data
```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather%>%
  select(Year,Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec)%>%
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13,names_to="Month",values_to="delta")

tidyweather

```


## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (title = "Weather Anomalies from 1880 - 2021", y ="Temperature Deviation", x = "Years")

```

**The effect of increasing temperature is more pronounced in the summer months of May, June, July, August and September as depicted by the steeper upward slopes in the five graphs of these respective months in the Monthly Weather Anomalies below. We can also see from the Yearly Weather Anomalies graph above that from 1980 onward, temperature deviation from NASA's base period temperatures has consistently increased.**


## Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a separate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. 

```{r tidy_facet_wrap}

tidyweather%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se=F, colour="red")+
  facet_wrap(~month,scale="free")+
  theme_bw()+
   labs(title="Monthly Weather Anomalies",
    x = "Years",
    y = "Temperature Deviation from NASA's Base Period")


```


## It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. 
```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))
print(comparison)
```

## Create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.
```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   
  theme_bw() +                
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"       
  )

```

## Calculate annual anomalies and display the result

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(average_annual_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= average_annual_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
 geom_smooth(method="loess") +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
theme_bw() +
  labs (title = "Yearly Average Anomaly from 1880 - 2021", y = "Average Annual Delta", x = "Years")     

```
