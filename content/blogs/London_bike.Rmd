## Import and inspect the datafile

The first step is to import the data into R. We will use either `readr::read_csv()` or `vroom::vroom()`-- I prefer the latter as it is a lot faster. Once you import any datafile, make sure the first thing you do is  use `janitor::clean_names()`

```{r bike-weather, echo = TRUE}
bike_weather <- vroom(here::here("data","london_bikes.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
         weekday = lubridate::wday(day, label=TRUE)
  )
```

Having imported the datafame, we need to inspect it to see what kind of variables it contains, whether there are any missing values, etc. 

```{r inspect_dataframe}

skimr::skim(bike_weather)

```


## Aesthetic mappings 

Map the column `day` onto the x axis and the column `temp` onto the y axis, and use `geom_line()` to display the data.


```{r ggplot_geom_line}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = day, y = temp)) +
  geom_line()
```
Try again, using  `geom_point()` instead of `geom_line()`.


```{r ggplot_geom_point}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = day, y = temp)) +
  geom_point()
```

And now swap which column you map to x and which to y.


```{r ggplot_geom_point_flipped}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = temp, y = day)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Ploting distributions of `temp`

First, we can use histograms
```{r ggplot_geom_histogram}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


For boxplots, we frequently want categorical data on the x or y axis. For example, we might want a separate boxplot for each month. Try this out. Put `month` on the x axis, `temp` on the y axis, and use `geom_boxplot()`.


```{r ggplot_geom_boxplot1}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = month, y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


## Adding colour

Make a scatter plot of `temp` against `day`, using the `colour` aesthetic to colour points by month. 

```{r ggplot_geom_point_colour}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = day, y = temp, colour=month)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Using the `fill` aesthetic

Some geoms use a `fill` aesthetic, which is similar to `colour` but applies to shaded areas, whereas the `colour` aesthetic applies to lines and points. For example, we can use the `fill` aesthetic with `geom_boxplot()` to colour the interior of the box. Try this yourself. Plot `month` on x, `temp` on y, and colour the interior of the box by the month.


```{r ggplot_geom_boxplot2}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = month, y = temp, colour=month)) +
  geom_boxplot()
