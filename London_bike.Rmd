# Task 1: London Bike Rentals and London weather

The dataset we will be working with contains the number of daily bike rentals in London as well as some temperature data for each day in London. The data for daily bike rentals comes from [TfL]( https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx) 


## Import and inspect the datafile

The first step is to import the data into R. We will use either `readr::read_csv()` or `vroom::vroom()`-- I prefer the latter as it is a lot faster. Once you import any datafile, make sure the first thing you do is  use `janitor::clean_names()`

```{r bike-weather, echo = TRUE}
bike_weather <- vroom(here::here("data","london_bikes.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
         weekday = lubridate::wday(day, label=TRUE)
  )
```

Having imported the datafame, we need to inspect it to see what kind of variables it contains, whether there are any missing values, etc. 

```{r inspect_dataframe}

skimr::skim(bike_weather)

```



## Aesthetic mappings 

In this first task, we will discuss a core concept of ggplot, the mapping of data values onto aesthetics. We will be using the R package **tidyverse**, which includes `ggplot()` and other related functions.

In the most basic use of ggplot, we call the `ggplot()` function with a dataset and an aesthetic mapping (created with `aes()`), and then we add a `geom`etry, such as `geom_line()` to draw lines or `geom_point()` to draw points.

Try this for yourself. Map the column `day` onto the x axis and the column `temp` onto the y axis, and use `geom_line()` to display the data.


```{r ggplot_geom_line}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = day, y = temp)) +
  geom_line()
```
Try again, using  `geom_point()` instead of `geom_line()`.


```{r ggplot_geom_point}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = day, y = temp)) +
  geom_point()
```

And now swap which column you map to x and which to y.


```{r ggplot_geom_point_flipped}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = temp, y = day)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Ploting distributions of `temp`

You can use other geoms to make different types of plots. For example, `geom_histogram` will make a histogram and `geom_boxplot()` will make boxplots. 


```{r ggplot_geom_histogram}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


For boxplots, we frequently want categorical data on the x or y axis. For example, we might want a separate boxplot for each month. Try this out. Put `month` on the x axis, `temp` on the y axis, and use `geom_boxplot()`.



```{r ggplot_geom_boxplot1}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = month, y = temp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


## Adding colour

Make a scatter plot of `temp` against `day`, using the `colour` aesthetic to colour points by month. 

```{r ggplot_geom_point_colour}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = day, y = temp, colour=month)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Using the `fill` aesthetic

Some geoms use a `fill` aesthetic, which is similar to `colour` but applies to shaded areas, whereas the `colour` aesthetic applies to lines and points. For example, we can use the `fill` aesthetic with `geom_boxplot()` to colour the interior of the box. Try this yourself. Plot `month` on x, `temp` on y, and colour the interior of the box by the month.


```{r ggplot_geom_boxplot2}
ggplot(bike_weather, aes(x = month, y = temp, colour=month)) +
  geom_boxplot()
